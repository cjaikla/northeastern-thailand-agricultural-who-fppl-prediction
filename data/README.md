# Data Folder

This folder does not contain raw data files.  
To run the notebooks in the `analysis` folder, please download the training and test datasets as described below.

## Training Data
- Raw sequence reads for the **training dataset** are publicly available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under **BioProject PRJNA1233617**, which can be downloaded from the [BioProject Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/).

- This dataset is associated with the publication:

  **Lakmuang, C., Ibrahim, S.N.M.M., Kaewjon, T., Kraisitudomsook, N., Somboonna, N., Chanabun, R., Chindamporn, A., Pombubpa, N., 2025. Exploring Fungal Abundance and WHO Fungal Priority Pathogens in Agricultural Fields: A One Health Perspective in Northeast Thailand. *Life* 15. doi:10.3390/life15030488**

- In addition to the training sequence dataset, the analysis requires supplementary environmental metadata and curated fungal community tables. These supplementary data files will be made available as part of the manuscript’s supplementary materials upon publication. For access prior to publication, please contact the corresponding author.

## Test Data 
- Raw sequence reads for the **test dataset** are publicly available in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under **BioProject PRJNA1307774**, which can be downloaded from the [BioProject Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/).
- This dataset is directly associated with the analyses presented in this repository.  
- In addition to the test sequence dataset, the analysis requires supplementary environmental metadata and curated fungal community tables. These supplementary data files will be made available as part of the manuscript’s supplementary materials upon publication. For access prior to publication, please contact the corresponding author.
