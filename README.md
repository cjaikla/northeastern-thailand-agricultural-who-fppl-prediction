## Overview

Environmental fungal pathogens pose significant risks to human and agricultural health, especially in regions with intensive farming and climate variability. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes pathogens such as *Candida tropicalis*, *Talaromyces marneffei*, and *Mucor* spp. in the Fungal Priority Pathogens List (FPPL), and these pathogens have been detected in both clinical and environmental samples in Thailand.

This repository provides notebooks and scripts for analyzing environmental and fungal community data from agricultural fields in Northeastern Thailand, with a focus on the WHO FPPL. The study applies next-generation sequencing (NGS) metabarcoding and decision tree models to characterize fungal communities and identify environmental conditions associated with the absence of WHO FPPL pathogens across 18 provinces.
